<h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Detecting Diabetes</strong> &mdash; build a model that predicts diabetes risk from clinical metrics like blood pressure, insulin levels, and BMI.</li>
    <li><strong>Matplotlib Practice</strong> &mdash; explore Matplotlib’s plotting capabilities through a gallery of charts and customization examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Q‑Learning Multi‑Armed Bandit</strong> &mdash; implement Q‑Learning to balance exploration and exploitation in the classic bandit problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong> &mdash; compare algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and SVMs on both classification and regression tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Wine Quality Test</strong> &mdash; predict wine quality from physicochemical attributes like acidity, residual sugar, and pH.</li>
    <li><strong>Satellite Imagery Classification</strong> &mdash; use convolutional neural networks to label satellite images by land‑cover category.</li>
    <li><strong>Backpack Price Prediction</strong> &mdash; leverage XGBoost to estimate backpack prices from product‑feature data.</li>
  </ul>
